              treasure, or npcs dont work let me know.\n\n\nJune 23rd, 2019\n\nAnother
              fix in place for the Merry's Tomb map.\n\n\nJune 22nd, 2019\n\nFixed
              an issue with the bank.  \n\nAdded a missing script to the party loot
              splitter in Gauntlet shop.\n\nAdded 80% Weight Reduction to Throwing
              Axes in Gauntlet shop.\n\nRemoved Mighty from Throwing weapons in Gauntlet
              shop to uncap their Mighty bonus.\n\nAdded charges to the Rod of Thunder
              and Lightning in Gauntlet shop.\n\nAdded description when you examine

              Aventurine, Diamond, Emerald, Fire Agate, Fire Opal, Flourspar, Garnet,
              Greenstone, Malachite, Phenalope, Ruby, Sapphire, and Topaz to this
              merchant for full price.\n\n\nJune 21st, 2019\n\nNWNX has been updated.
              \ This has resolved the issue with saving throws not being applied in

              force it to run back and stay at a distance if they're a ranged npc.\n\nBug
              fix for Bless Weapon script.  Will now apply On-Hit Slay Rak on ranged
              ammo and throwing weapons.  Gloves and Melee weapons get 2d6 Divine

              party members.  This is to encourage players to login together and level
              up.  \n\nThe Gauntlet bosses and mini-bosses that naturally do not get
              Immunity: Sneak Attack now do not get this immunity.\n\nAttempting an
              improvement on the A.I. of the Gauntlet 9 spawns.  Will increase spawn
              rate if needed on another update.\n\nFix put in place to report the

              the book so to speak.\n\nThis system will allow you to cast a spell
              from a scroll or item if:\n\n - You can regularly cast that level spell
              due to innate abilities.\n - You pass either a UMD or Spellcraft check
              for that level spell.\n - You have the spell memorzied in your spellbook.\n\nShareSpell
              - Simply cast a known spell using your innate ability upon yourself
              and it will be transfered to your familiar. \n\nFailure to cast counts
              as a use and per BW default, may result in the destruction of the item.\n\nIf
              players have either a UMD or Spellcraft skill level of 5 or higher and
              they have both skills, they recieve a synergy bonus.  This will result
              in the player seeing a skill level 2 higher than on the character sheet
              because the game does not account for this synergy even though it is
              a standard 3rd Edition rule.  The code then appropriately decides which
              skill to use (either craft or UMD) after this synergy adjustment is
              made."
